## 🔥 What I'm Building

I thrive at the intersection of **AI, innovation, and collaboration**—creating solutions that actually make a difference. Currently at **IBM Watson**, I'm working on:

- 🤖 **Generative AI Solutions**: RAG, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and multimodal magic
- 🏗️ **AI Orchestration**: Building systems that just *work* at scale
- 📈 **Enterprise Solutions**: Delivering high-impact AI implementations for diverse clients
- 🚀 **Performance Optimization**: Making applications blazingly fast and efficient

### 🎉 Latest Launch: [Multi-Agent Generator](https://pypi.org/project/multi-agent-generator/)

Just dropped my **Python library** that's making multi-agent systems accessible to everyone!

```bash
pip install multi-agent-generator
```

**The Problem:** Building multi-agent systems used to mean framework complexity, repetitive coding, and provider lock-in.

**The Solution:** Just describe your idea in plain English → get production-ready code! 

✨ **Key Features:**
- **Framework Flexibility**: Works with CrewAI (+ flows), LangChain, LangGraph, and ReAct
- **Provider Choice**: Switch between OpenAI GPT and IBM WatsonX with a click
- **Zero Coding**: Describe your need, the library handles the rest!

🚀 **1000+ downloads in the first month** - the community is loving it!
