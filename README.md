**Creater** of [multi-agent-generator](https://pypi.org/project/multi-agent-generator/) [![PyPI Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/multi-agent-generator?period=total&units=INTERNATIONAL_SYSTEM&left_color=BLACK&right_color=GREEN&left_text=downloads)](https://pepy.tech/projects/multi-agent-generator) and ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/aakriti1318/multi-agent-generator)

```bash
pip install multi-agent-generator
```

I build and deploy **scalable, enterprise-grade Generative AI solutions**. My core focus is on **AI governance and security**, ensuring robust defense against adversarial attacks and compliance in production environments.

### **🛡️ Secured & Scalable AI Solutions**

My work centers on designing systems that are fast, compliant, and resilient:

* **AI Security & Governance (Defense First):**
    * Implemented a **Policy Decision Point (PDP)** within the AI proxy layer to enforce governance and security.
    * Drove **policy-based request validation** and **prompt-injection defense** to ensure enterprise-grade AI compliance.
    * Developing an **IAM framework** for LLM-based agent systems, adding RBAC-style tool permissions and policy enforcement (PDP/PEP) for secure orchestration.
* **Performance Engineering:**
    * Re-engineered document enrichment pipelines, cutting latency by **90%** (from 3000s to 290s) through async parallelization and optimized $I/O$ operations.
    * Optimized RAG systems with token-aware truncation and dynamic context window management for large-scale enterprise documents.
* **Core Systems:** Architected and deployed scalable Generative AI solutions (RAG, multimodal, agentic) using WatsonX, driving **€6M in client revenue**.

### **🥇 Achievements & Open-Source Impact**

I actively contribute to the community and drive thought leadership in secured GenAI:

* Developed the Python library **`multi-agent-generator`** Open-Source, translating plain English into production-ready multi-agent AI teams.
* **Microsoft MVP (AI) 2025-26:** Recognized for outstanding contributions to AI and the developer community.
* **Published Author & Voice:** Authored **80+ technical blogs** on [Medium](https://medium.com/@aakriti-aggarwal) on GenAI, LLMs, and **AI governance**.
* **Award-Winning Research:** Lead Author for the **IEEE & ICSC Conference Publication 2020** on DeepFake Detection Methodology.
* **IBM Growth Award:**  Culture Catalyst extraordinaire - Q3 2024
* **SAP Certified:** Expert Speaker (AI & Digital Transformation), Made AI less scary for humans
* **Multiple Hackathon Wins:** (enterprise & open-innovation)
* **Speaking & Community Impact:** Speaker at 30+ Technical Events including Microsoft, IBM, SAP, IIIT Delhi and other prestigious institutions.

### 🌱 Building what's next in AI Agents, RAG, and Secure LLM Infrastructure?

I'd love to chat, collaborate, or offer technical consultation.
Always open to joining as a **co-founder** for ideas focused on LLM security, governance layers, or safe multi-agent orchestration.
